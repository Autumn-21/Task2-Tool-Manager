Simple Tool Manager

This Python project provides a graphical interface for managing tools such as ngspice. The application allows users to install, uninstall, and check for updates for tools based on the operating system. The implementation includes support for Linux and Windows.

Features

Install tools (e.g., ngspice)

Uninstall tools

Check for tool updates

Platform-specific command support

Easy-to-use GUI built with Tkinter

Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

General Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher

Download and install Python from python.org.

pip (Python package manager)

Comes pre-installed with Python. If not, install it using:

python -m ensurepip --upgrade

Platform-Specific Tools

For Linux

Ensure sudo is available for package management.

ngspice installation requires apt package manager.

For Windows

Install Chocolatey for package management. Refer to the official Chocolatey installation guide.

Required Python Libraries

tkinter (Built-in with Python)

subprocess

platform

os

How It Works

Installation:

Uses platform-specific commands to install the selected tool.

Checks if the tool is already installed before proceeding.

Uninstallation:

Uses platform-specific commands to uninstall the selected tool.

Update Check:

Checks for updates using platform-specific commands and displays the result.

Supported Commands

Installation Commands

OS

Command

Linux

Note

The GUI may require elevated privileges (administrator or root access) for installing or uninstalling tools.

Ensure network connectivity for installation and update checks.

Troubleshooting

If the tool fails to install or uninstall, check the logs printed to the terminal for detailed error messages.

For ngspice commands to work on Windows, ensure Chocolatey is properly installed and configured.

If tkinter is missing, install it via your systemâ€™s package manager (e.g., sudo apt install python3-tk on Linux).
